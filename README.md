## :unicorn: About the _theme_

 I have started collating some info on the themes in the slides... I plan to add more information on how these are structured and how to properly use the slides... bare with me.

The themes used in these slides is a hihgly customised, opinionated theme. basically this includes:
- highlight js themes I like
- responsive slides and fonts
- a number of slides elements I often use for my presentations
- light and dark slides themes
- a number of fonts combinations

ðŸ‘¾ More information on the fonts, themes and background patterns available can be found [here](Themes_docs.md)


For a full demo of a light coloured slide check:
