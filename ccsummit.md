# Working in the open principles

Let's draw the parallels between open source and research software

Rubric:
<br>
⭐️ General open source principles
<br>
📖 Research software outputs

---

## OSS as a positive agent of change
⭐️Open source should enrich the lives of human beings and broader communities.

<p class='fragment> 📖 Research software should support the research community to do better researchand the wider population. </p>

---

## Building for participation
⭐️ Open source is a community effort by the community. It should aim to lower the entry and participation barriers.

<p class='fragment> 📖 Should enable collaborative work (reproducibility and replication) </p>

---
## Free access

⭐️ The code should be open and freely accesible (freely available to the world).

<p class='fragment> 📖 Should be made public/freely available at publication time </p>

---

## Open leadership

⭐️ Transparent governance model: support both the project and its community. 

<p class='fragment>📖 When public funds are used the code should be public too...</p>

---

## Diversity, inclusion and belonging

⭐️ Include the commonly margninalized voices in the community and amplify them. Build a supportive, equalitarian space for each individual to thrive in.

<p class='fragment> 📖 Should not discriminate against groups or technologies. </p>

---

## Sustainability

⭐️ Buiding communities help ensure sustainability, liaise with organisations across the world and draw a roadmap.

<p class='fragment> 📖 ????? Survive the grant  </p>

## 🗣Discussion time

👉🏽 What do you think are the largest barriers to open research?

---
Add your thoughts here :

---

## Who decides about open research and its outputs?

- Funding bodies
- Agencies
- Institutions and Universities
- Researchers
- Others ?

---

The region where you live greatly determines the role you and your institution play on the open research matters.

The global North drives the open movement (OpenCon, Open Research Alliance, Research Software Engineers Association, URSSI...)

---

## 🗣 Who should be empowered to decide on the matter?
## 🗣 How can we include the global South in the conversation?

---

## Empowering for the future

1. Get in groups of 3: try and form diverse groups (areas of expertise, geographical areas, backgrounds)
2. Introduce yourself to each other
3. Identify the systemic or organisational barriers each of you have faced in ther past to make research, research code and research data open
4. How did this experience change the way you engage with the open community?
5. How could we empower others in your position to overcome said situtations?
6. Imagine its 2029: how does the research software panorama look like?
